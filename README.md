WIP: here there be dragons


These are 'helper' images for my neovim based [toolbox](https://github.com/grantmacken/zie-toolbox)
I do not install runtimes like nodejs jvm locally and also keep these 'runtimes'
out of my main toolbox. Instead runtimes are in containers images. One image for each runtime.
The second category of images built here are CLI tools that are not included in my toolbox
These are LSP servers and diagnostic linters or formatters
